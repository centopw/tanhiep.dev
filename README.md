My personal profolio creat using ReactJS


## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the source code for my personal website built using React.js. The website showcases my portfolio, skills, projects, and other relevant information.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cento/tanhiep.dev.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
     cd tanhiep.dev
   
3. Install dependencies using npm or Yarn:
   
    ```bash
     npm install
     # or
     yarn install

## Development

To run the development server, use the following command:

  ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
  ```

This will start a local development server and open the website in your default web browser. The website will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source files.
